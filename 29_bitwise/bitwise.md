Objective
Welcome to the last day! Today, we're discussing bitwise operations. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task
Given set . Find two integers, and (where ), from set such that the value of is the maximum possible and also less than a given integer, . In this case, represents the bitwise AND operator.

Function Description
Complete the bitwiseAnd function in the editor below.

bitwiseAnd has the following paramter(s):

- int N: the maximum integer to consider
- int K: the limit of the result, inclusive

Returns

- int: the maximum value of within the limit.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, , the number of test cases.
Each of the subsequent lines defines a test case as space-separated integers, and , respectively.

Constraints

Sample Input

STDIN Function

3 T = 3
5 2 N = 5, K = 2
8 5 N = 8, K = 5
2 2 N = 8, K = 5
Sample Output

1
4
0
Explanation

All possible values of and are:

The maximum possible value of that is also is , so we print on a new line.
